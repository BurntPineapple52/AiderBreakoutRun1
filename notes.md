- aider model settings are a little confusing.  Settings I'd consider pretty essential to day to day LLM usage, like temp, top p, top k, etc are considered "advanced" for the most part.  There's also a confusing "you can pass settings to liteLLM", which is great to be able to do, but it sucks that it's so maze like to get to basic model settings. 
- Repo map is awesome, I'm going to see if it works in a tiny amount of context, like 100 tokens
- dealing with a final bug where, when the level changes, the ball stays in movement and keeps knocking out blocks, making the game too easy
